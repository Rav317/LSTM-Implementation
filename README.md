# LSTM-Implementation
Google Stock Price prediction using LSTM model.

Used the data provided on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/medharawat/google-stock-price.
```
The implementation involves data preprocessing from scratch using pandas and numpy.

Sklearn is used for data reforming.

Tensorflow and keras are used for building the model architecture.

Matplotlib is later used for visualizing of data.

Explanation is given at each step for proper documentation of all the steps.
